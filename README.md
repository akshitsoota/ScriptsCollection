While working on a few of my projects, I ended up writing some scripts/wrappers which I add to this repo. 
Feel free to use them as you need!

### Python Scripts

- [Script](https://github.com/akshitsoota/ScriptsCollection/tree/master/GooglePolyline-Python) to encode and decode
LatLng pairs into Google's Encoded Polyline Format (more infomation can be found 
[here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm))
